# Python Bindings for Raylib 3.5

New CFFI API static bindings.  Faster, fewer bugs and easier to maintain than ctypes.

# Install

## Option 1: Install from Pypi (easiest but currently out of date, Raylib 2.6 and Python 3.6 - 3.8)

**Windows 10 (64 bit): Python 3.6 - 3.8**

**MacOS: Python 3.6 - 3.8**

**Linux (Ubuntu 16.04+): Python 3.6 - 3.8**

We distribute a statically linked Raylib library,  install from Pypi.

    pip3 install raylib

## Option 2: Install from github (Raylib 3.5, Python 3.6 - 3.9, Linux, awaiting builds for other platforms)
    
The version on Pypi may not always be up to date.  If you want to test the latest version,
clone the git repo and make a symlink to the `raylib` directory in your current project directory.

## Option 3: Build from source (Raylib 3.5, all platforms)

If you're using a platform we dont have binary builds for yet
then you can either *use the dynamic binding with your own dll* or else you will have to build from source.
If you do build on a new platform please
submit your binaries as a PR.

These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 20.10 and 16.04.  Mac should be very similar.  Windows is probably different.

Clone this repo including submodules so you get correct version of Raylib.

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/electronstudio/raylib-python-cffi

Build and install Raylib from the raylib-c directory.

    cd raylib-python-cffi/raylib-c
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DWITH_PIC=on -DSTATIC=on -DSHARED=on ..
    sudo make install

Make a patched version of raylib header.

    cd ../../raylib
    cp raylib.h raylib_modified.h
    patch  -p0 <raylib_modified.h.patch

Build 

    cd static
    pip3 install cffi
    python3 build_linux.py
    
To build a complete set of libs for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9:

    ./build_linux_multi.sh
    
To update the Linux dynamic libs (names will be different on other platfroms):

    cd ../..
    rm raylib/dynamic/*.so*
    cp -P /usr/local/lib/libraylib.so* raylib/dynamic/

### Raspberry Pi

The integrated GPU hardware in a Raspberry Pi ("VideoCore") is rather
idiosyncratic, resulting in a complex set of software options. Probably the
most interesting two options for Raylib applications are:

 1. Use the Broadcom proprietary Open GL ES 2.0 drivers, installed by Raspbian
    into `/opt/vc`. These are 32-bit only, and currently X11 doesn't use these
    for its acceleration, so this is most suitable for driving the entire HDMI
    output from one application with minimal overhead (no X11).

 2. Use the more recent open-source `vc4-fkms-v3d` kernel driver. This can run
    in either 32-bit or 64-bit, and X11 can use these, so using X11 is probably
    the more common choice here.

With option 2, the regular linux install instructions above should probably
work as-is.

For option 1, then also follow the above instructions, but with these
modifications:

 - With `cmake`, use `cmake -DWITH_PIC=on -DSTATIC=on -DSHARED=on -DPLATFORM='Raspberry Pi' ..`
 - Use `python3 build_rpi_nox.py` instead of `python3 build_linux.py`
 - Use `build_rpi_nox_multi.sh` to build a complete set of libs if you need it
   (if you're not sure, then you almost certainly don't).

# Use

## raylib.static

Goal is make usage as similar to the original C as CFFI will allow.  There are a few differences
you can see in the examples.  See test_static.py and examples/*.py for how to use.

```
from raylib.static import *

InitWindow(800, 450, b"Hello Raylib")
SetTargetFPS(60)

camera = ffi.new("struct Camera3D *", [[18.0, 16.0, 18.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], 45.0, 0])
SetCameraMode(camera[0], CAMERA_ORBITAL)

while not WindowShouldClose():
    UpdateCamera(camera)
    BeginDrawing()
    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE)
    BeginMode3D(camera[0])
    DrawGrid(20, 1.0)
    EndMode3D()
    DrawText(b"Hellow World", 190, 200, 20, VIOLET)
    EndDrawing()
CloseWindow()

```

## raylib.pyray

Wrapper around the static bindings.  Makes the names snakecase and converts strings to bytes automatically.  See test_pyray.py.


```
from raylib.pyray import PyRay
from raylib.colors import *

pyray = PyRay()

pyray.init_window(800, 450, "Hello Pyray")
pyray.set_target_fps(60)

camera = pyray.Camera3D([18.0, 16.0, 18.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], 45.0, 0)
pyray.set_camera_mode(camera, pyray.CAMERA_ORBITAL)

while not pyray.window_should_close():
    pyray.update_camera(camera)
    pyray.begin_drawing()
    pyray.clear_background(RAYWHITE)
    pyray.begin_mode_3d(camera)
    pyray.draw_grid(20, 1.0)
    pyray.end_mode_3d()
    pyray.draw_text("Hello world", 190, 200, 20, VIOLET)
    pyray.end_drawing()
pyray.close_window()

```

## raylib.dynamic

In addition to the API static bindings we have CFFI ABI dynamic bindings in order to avoid the need to compile a C extension module.
There have been some weird failures with dynamic bindings and ctypes bindings before and often the failures are silent
so you dont even know.  Also the static bindings should be faster.  Therefore I recommend the static ones...

BUT the dynamic bindings have the big advantage that you don't need to compile anything to install.  You just need a Raylib DLL,
which we supply for Windows/Mac/Linux.

See test_dynamic.py for how to use.
